*Enhancing Customer Experience & Reducing Operational Costs in Amazon Last-Mile Logistics*

## 🚚 Amazon Last-Mile Delivery Proposal 
### Proposal Overview  
Last-mile delivery is the **most critical and costly** step in Amazon’s logistics chain.  

- **Customers** face frustration waiting for deliveries, especially **high-value or bulky items**, often feeling “hostage at home.”  
- **Amazon and sellers** incur **additional fuel, labor, and time costs** due to failed deliveries.  
- **Delivery partners** experience stress and inefficiencies when deliveries fail or must be rescheduled.  

We propose **Tik-Tik: Smart Timer Delivery System** – an **interactive, confirmation-based solution** to reduce failed deliveries, improve customer experience, and optimize last-mile operations.

## ✨ The Story – The Spark

**Picture this**

It was a typical morning. A young man had ordered a new piece of furniture, something he had been eagerly waiting for. He had already paid for it, but there was one catch: the delivery window was vague—somewhere between morning and evening.

From the moment he received the delivery confirmation, his day was on hold. Every call, every plan, every task was postponed because he had to be home. He didn’t know exactly when the delivery would arrive, only that he couldn’t leave the house. Hours passed slowly, tension grew, and the excitement of receiving the new furniture turned into frustration.

This experience highlighted a simple yet powerful truth: **it’s not about waiting for hours—it’s about knowing when to wait.**

And that’s where **Tik-Tik** was born: a smart, timer-based delivery system designed to give customers clarity, control, and confidence—so they could plan their day instead of being hostage to uncertainty.

## 😫 Key Challenges  

### Customer Pain Points  
- ❌ Missed delivery due to short absences (even 2 mins outside).  
- ❌ Broad delivery windows (e.g., 2–6 PM) → uncertainty.  
- ❌ High anxiety for **paid/furniture/electronics** deliveries.  

### Operational & Seller Challenges  
- 💸 High rescheduling costs (fuel, labor, traffic).  
- 🕒 Wasted truck/trip slots for large-item deliveries.  
- 📉 Reduced customer trust due to repeated failed deliveries.  

### Delivery Partner Challenges  
- 😓 Stress of returning undelivered packages.  
- 🚦 Route delays and inefficiencies if customers are unavailable.

## 📊 Amazon Last-Mile Delivery Insights (Data-Driven)  

- **Cost per Failed Delivery**: ~$17.78 per attempt  
- **Failure Rate**: ~5% due to customer unavailability  
- **Impact**: Redelivery doubles last-mile costs, increases fuel consumption, and wastes delivery partner effort  

> **Pre-delivery confirmation with timer-based tracking can reduce failed deliveries by 30–40%, saving millions annually while improving customer satisfaction and delivery efficiency.**

**Pre-Delivery:**  
- Customer receives a **prompt to confirm availability**.  
- Option to **reschedule delivery** if unavailable.  

**Post-Confirmation:**  
- Timer starts (**30-min countdown for small items, 2-hour slot for furniture**).  
- Rider progress displayed with **live simulation**.  
- Clear ETA reduces stress and uncertainty.  

**Reschedule Flow:**  
- Customer selects **preferred time slot** (e.g., after 2 PM or 4 PM).  
- App confirms reschedule and updates delivery status.

## 💰 Projected Annual Savings  

**Assumptions:**  
- Average cost per failed delivery: $17.78  
- Failure rate: 5% of total deliveries  
- Total deliveries per year: 1,000,000,000  
- Expected reduction in failed deliveries: 30%  

**Calculation:**  
1. Total failed deliveries = 1,000,000,000 × 5% = 50,000,000  
2. Total cost of failed deliveries = 50,000,000 × $17.78 ≈ $889,000,000  
3. Reduced failed deliveries = 50,000,000 × 30% = 15,000,000  
4. **Potential annual savings** = 15,000,000 × $17.78 ≈ **$266.7 million**  

> **Impact:** Amazon could save over **$266 million annually**, reduce operational inefficiencies, and improve both customer and delivery partner satisfaction.

## 🛠️ UX Flow Snapshot  

**Furniture Buyer:**  
1. Prompt: Confirm availability or reschedule  
2. If confirmed → Timer starts (2-hr slot) + Rider ETA  
3. Delivery → success or fallback with rescheduling fee  

**Small-Item Buyer:**  
1. Prompt: Confirm availability or reschedule  
2. If confirmed → Timer starts (30-min countdown) + Rider progress  
3. Delivery → success or reschedule if needed
