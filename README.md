# 🚚 Tik-Tik - Smart Timer Delivery System  
*Balancing Customer Convenience & Seller Costs in Last-Mile Logistics*  

---

## 📌 Context  
Last-mile delivery is the **costliest and most critical** step in e-commerce.  

- For **customers**, waiting for deliveries (especially **paid products**) feels like being “hostage at home.”  
- For **sellers**, failed deliveries (especially **furniture**) mean **extra petrol, traffic delays, and wasted manpower**.  
- For **delivery partners**, reattempts add **stress and inefficiency**.  

This case study proposes a **Smart Timer Delivery System** to minimize failures and improve experience for all parties.

## 😫 Pain Points  

### Customer  
- ❌ Even 2 mins outside = missed delivery.  
- ❌ Broad delivery slots (2–6 PM) → uncertainty.  
- ❌ Paid products (furniture, electronics) = higher anxiety.  

### Seller / Platform (Amazon)  
- 💸 High rescheduling costs (fuel, traffic, labor).  
- 🕒 Wasted truck slots for large-item deliveries.  
- 📉 Customer dissatisfaction → lower trust.  

### Delivery Partner  
- 😓 Stress of carrying furniture only to return undelivered.  
- 🚦 Route delays if customer is unavailable.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Smart Timer Delivery System  

### 🏠 1. Interactive Confirmation & Timer  
- **Before delivery timer starts:**  
  - Customer receives a **prompt to confirm availability**.  
  - Option to **reschedule delivery** if unavailable.  

- **After confirmation:**  
  - Timer starts (**30-min countdown for small items, 2-hour slot for furniture**).  
  - Rider progress is displayed with live simulation.  
  - Clear ETA reduces stress and uncertainty.  

- **Reschedule flow:**  
  - Customer can select a **preferred time slot** (e.g., After 2 PM or After 4 PM).  
  - App confirms reschedule and updates status.

## 🛠️ UX Flow Snapshot  

**Furniture Buyer**  
1. Prompt: Confirm availability or reschedule  
2. If confirmed → Timer starts (2-hr slot) + Rider ETA  
3. Delivery → success OR fallback with rescheduling fee  

**Small-Item Buyer**  
1. Prompt: Confirm availability or reschedule  
2. If confirmed → Timer starts (30-min countdown) + Rider progress  
3. Delivery → success or reschedule if needed

## 📊 Amazon Last-Mile Delivery Insights (Data-Driven)

- **Cost per Failed Delivery**: ~$17.78 per failed attempt.  
- **Failure Rate**: ~5% of all last-mile deliveries fail due to customer unavailability.  
- **Impact**: Redelivery attempts double last-mile costs, increase fuel consumption, and waste delivery partner effort.  

> Implementing a **pre-delivery confirmation and timer-based system** can reduce failed deliveries by up to **30-40%**, saving millions annually for Amazon, while improving customer trust and delivery partner efficiency.

### ⏱️ 2. Live Countdown & Rider Tracking  
- Timer visible only after **confirmation**.  
- Progress bar and rider icon move dynamically along delivery route simulation.

- Features:  
  - Direct customer call/chat.  
  - Address validation before leaving hub.

## 💰 Projected Annual Savings (Profit Assumption)

**Assumptions:**  
- Average cost per failed delivery: $17.78  
- Failure rate: 5% of total deliveries  
- Total deliveries per year: 1,000,000,000  
- Expected reduction in failed deliveries: 30%  

**Calculation:**  
1. Total failed deliveries = 1,000,000,000 × 5% = 50,000,000  
2. Total cost of failed deliveries = 50,000,000 × $17.78 ≈ $889,000,000  
3. Reduced failed deliveries = 50,000,000 × 30% = 15,000,000  
4. **Potential annual savings** = 15,000,000 × $17.78 ≈ **$266.7 million**  

> By implementing the Smart Timer Delivery System, Amazon could **save over $266 million annually**, reduce operational inefficiencies, and improve customer and delivery partner satisfaction.

  - Data-backed cost savings for the platform (Amazon).  
  - Delivery partner efficiency and stress reduction.  

- Shows how **small UX interventions** (confirmation & timer) can **drive millions in operational savings** and improve customer satisfaction.
