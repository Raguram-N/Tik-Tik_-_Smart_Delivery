## 🚚 Amazon Last-Mile Delivery Proposal: Tik-Tik Smart Timer System  
*Enhancing Customer Experience & Reducing Operational Costs in Last-Mile Logistics*  

---

### 📌 Proposal Overview  
Last-mile delivery is the **most critical and costly** step in Amazon’s logistics chain.  

- **Customers** face frustration waiting for deliveries, especially **high-value or bulky items**, often feeling “hostage at home.”  
- **Amazon and sellers** incur **additional fuel, labor, and time costs** due to failed deliveries.  
- **Delivery partners** experience stress and inefficiencies when deliveries fail or must be rescheduled.  

We propose **Tik-Tik: Smart Timer Delivery System** – an interactive, confirmation-based system to **reduce failed deliveries, improve customer experience, and optimize last-mile operations**.

### 😫 Key Challenges  

### Customer Pain Points  
- ❌ Missing delivery due to short absences (even 2 mins outside).  
- ❌ Broad delivery windows (e.g., 2–6 PM) → uncertainty.  
- ❌ High anxiety for **paid/furniture/electronics** deliveries.  

### Operational & Seller Challenges  
- 💸 High rescheduling costs (fuel, labor, traffic).  
- 🕒 Wasted truck/trip slots for large-item deliveries.  
- 📉 Reduced customer trust due to repeated failed deliveries.  

### Delivery Partner Challenges  
- 😓 Stress of returning undelivered packages.  
- 🚦 Route delays and inefficiencies if customers are unavailable.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Tik-Tik Smart Timer System  

### 🏠 1. Interactive Confirmation & Timer  
- **Pre-Delivery:**  
  - Customers receive a **prompt to confirm availability**.  
  - Option to **reschedule delivery** if unavailable.  

- **Post-Confirmation:**  
  - Timer starts (**30-min countdown for small items, 2-hour slot for furniture**).  
  - Rider progress displayed with **live simulation**.  
  - Clear ETA reduces customer stress and uncertainty.  

- **Reschedule Flow:**  
  - Customer selects **preferred time slot** (e.g., after 2 PM or 4 PM).  
  - App confirms reschedule and updates delivery status.  

---

### ⏱️ 2. Live Countdown & Rider Tracking  
- Timer visible **only after confirmation**.  
- Progress bar and rider icon move dynamically along delivery route simulation.  

---

### 🔔 3. Smart Notifications  
- **Pre-timer:** “Confirm your availability for delivery.”  
- **Post-confirmation:** Live countdown + rider on the way.  
- **Reschedule:** Option to select preferred time slot.  

---

### 📦 4. Furniture Delivery Fallback  
- If customer not home despite confirmation:  
  - Item sent to **local hub/warehouse**.  
  - Customer pays **rescheduling fee** upfront.  

---

### 👷 5. Delivery Partner Support  
- App shows **customer confirmation status**.  
- Features:  
  - Direct customer call/chat.  
  - Address validation before leaving hub.  
  - Priority flag for **“Paid & Confirmed” deliveries**.

## 📊 Amazon Last-Mile Delivery Insights (Data-Driven)  

- **Cost per Failed Delivery**: ~$17.78 per attempt.  
- **Failure Rate**: ~5% due to customer unavailability.  
- **Impact**: Redelivery doubles last-mile costs, increases fuel consumption, and wastes delivery partner effort.  

> **Implementing pre-delivery confirmation and timer-based tracking can reduce failed deliveries by 30–40%, saving millions annually while improving customer satisfaction and delivery efficiency.**  

---

## 💰 Projected Annual Savings  

**Assumptions:**  
- Average cost per failed delivery: $17.78  
- Failure rate: 5% of total deliveries  
- Total deliveries per year: 1,000,000,000  
- Expected reduction in failed deliveries: 30%  

**Calculation:**  
1. Total failed deliveries = 1,000,000,000 × 5% = 50,000,000  
2. Total cost of failed deliveries = 50,000,000 × $17.78 ≈ $889,000,000  
3. Reduced failed deliveries = 50,000,000 × 30% = 15,000,000  
4. **Potential annual savings** = 15,000,000 × $17.78 ≈ **$266.7 million**  

> **Impact:** Amazon could save over **$266 million annually**, reduce operational inefficiencies, and improve both customer and delivery partner satisfaction.
